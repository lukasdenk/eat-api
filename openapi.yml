        Here dish_type is also normalized. All tailing digits and spaces get
        removed from dish_type. For example Tagesgericht 1 -> Tagesgericht and
        Aktionsessen 6 -> Aktionsessen. Also ignores all menus older than one
        day. This results in this file being usually half the size of the
        all.json file.
        This is currently deprecated, and only supported in the german language.
